A template for appending content to the `.gitignore` file of your Flutter project that is using [mason][1] so as to ignore all its default generated files from being deployed to github as they are not needed.

_Generated by [mason][1] ðŸ§±_

## Getting Started ðŸš€

This is a starting point for a new brick.

## Steps to use this brick

## 1. Create flutter project using the `xephas_app` template brick

The [`xephas_app`][8] brick can be obtained from Github and all it's usage details can be found in its README.md file of the brick.

The brick also uses the variables from the json file used to create your project from the [xephas_app][8] brick to generate the brick.

## 2. Add the brick to the project `mason.yaml` file using one of the 2 methods below

### 2.1. From Github

Bricks can also be imported via remote git url.

a) To import the `mason_gitignore` brick from git, use the commands below

```bash
bricks:
#a) start here incase the bricks tag is present in the mason.yaml file to add the path to our brick on github
  mason_gitignore:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/capps096github/Cephas-Bricks.git
      path: mason_gitignore

```

b) then run mason get, to get the `mason_gitignore` brick from github

```bash
mason get
```

c) (Optional) to test if the `mason_gitignore` brick was got from github run the command below to see a list of installed bricks on your machine

```bash
mason ls
```

### 2.2 From Local Storage (Preferred)

This also comes with Hooks for installing all packages and plugins needed for the app to run

Incase the brick already exists on your machine, or incase you have cloned this repo folder containing the mason brick, You can then generate the brick locally via

```bash
  mason_gitignore:
    path: "location of brick on your machine"
```

For example, the command below assumes that the brick named `mason_gitignore` exists in the location `E:\Cephas-Bricks\mason_gitignore` however `\\` escape character is used to represent `\`

```bash
  mason_gitignore:
    path: "E:\\Cephas-Bricks\\mason_gitignore"
```

then steps `2.1.b)` and `2.1.c)` above can be used here as the next steps

## 3. Usage

### 3.1. Variables

These are highlighted in the `json` file, but here is a list of the variables that can be used to generate the brick

- app_name
  > This is the flutter app name of your project as used when generating your brick using  the [xephas_app brick][8] e.g sample_app, calcut, akatabo, first_app, example_app etc. (Using flutter app name conventions i.e app_name) or (using dart package name conventions i.e app_name) or (just lowercase app name i.e appname)
- ignore_mason_files
    > This is a boolean value that determines whether to ignore the mason files or not. It is `set to true by default`

### 3.2. Create a json file to generate the brick

This is created in the root directory of the project, and is used to generate the brick

A sample json file labeled `app_name.json` is shown below

```json
{
  "app_name": "name of the app",
  "ignore_mason_files": true
}
```

**Note:**
Incase you have used the [xephas_app][8] brick to generate your project, then the `app_name.json` file is already created for you, and you can just edit it to add the `ignore_mason_files` variable as below

```json
{
  "app_name": "name of the app",
  "app_title": "title of the app mostly used for SEO",
  "app_description": "Brief description of the app",
  "primary_color_code": "primary color",
  "secondary_color_code": "seconday color",
  "background_color_code": "200E32",
  "has_navbar": true,
  "ignore_mason_files": true
}
```

### 3.3. Generate the brick

a) To use this brick, run the following command:

*_we prefer using a `json` file to generate the brick since it contains many variables, and any existing files will be overwritten_*

```bash
mason make mason_gitignore -c app_name.json --on-conflict append
```

## 4. Output

This will append the following content to the `.gitignore` file of your project:

```bash

#ignore all those files generated by mason
mason*
.mason/

# also ignore the json file used to create this app
app_name.json

# ignore the variable test file
app_name_vars.txt

```
